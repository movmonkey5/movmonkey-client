              The rules and regulations established by MovMonkey for the use of
              its website, www.movmonkey.com, are referred to herein as the
              "Terms". You and MovMonkey enter into a legally binding contract
              when you use the MovMonkey platform for removal, delivery and
              cleaning services. This contract represents your agreement to
              abide by all of the Terms as they may change in the future. You
              become a "User" in the MovMonkey community by accessing or using
              the Platform; you will then be classified as a "Driver" and/or
              Service Provider depending on how you use the Platform. Customers
              requiring removal, delivery and cleaning services are connected to
              third party drivers or service providers through our platform.
              Drivers are self-employed individuals who choose to provide these
              services to customers who post jobs. It's important to understand
              that MovMonkey has no control over when a customer posts a job or
              when a driver or service provider submits a bid. Furthermore,
              drivers can work for many clients at the same time or on different
              platforms. It is entirely up to the driver to decide whether to
              bid on and complete the removal, delivery and cleaning services
              requested by the client.{" "}

              You will be required to provide photo identification such as a
              passport, valid driver's licence, social security number and proof
              of insurance when you sign up as a driver or service provider. A
              thorough background check is conducted by a third party
              organisation as part of the agreement you sign with MovMonkey. You
              must complete this check before you can start bidding on jobs
              requested by customers. In addition, as long as the checks comply
              with legal requirements, we reserve the right to conduct
              additional checks whenever we deem it appropriate, without asking
              for your consent again. Â  <br /> <br />
              The scope of this background check includes checking any criminal
              records and analysing your Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) to learn
              more about your driving history. Please note, however, that we
              don't check credit scores as part of this process. If there's no
              obstacle, we expect this process to take one to two weeks.{" "}

              MovMonkey takes seriously its obligation to investigate a driver's
              or service provider's criminal history within the law. We do not
              automatically reject applicants based on their criminal history.
              Our method is to go through each applicant's history in great
              detail, paying particular attention to things that are relevant to
              the position. MovMonkey has the final say on whether to approve a
              driver as we want to keep the platform safe and secure for all
              users.{" "}

              Drivers and service providers must have a valid driver's licence,
              valid driver's insurance and medical insurance before bidding for
              work. Drivers and service providers must maintain current auto
              insurance, including liability insurance, in accordance with state
              laws and the terms of their insurance policy in order to perform
              tasks through the MovMonkey service. Failure to have the
              appropriate insurance could result in denial of employment
              opportunities and possibly termination of service. Drivers and
              service providers are expected to have their insurance
              documentation with them at all times. Before bidding for a job, we
              strongly advise drivers and service providers to confirm with
              insurance and licensing specialists that they have all the
              necessary documentation and cover. If a driver, service provider
              or customer does not have the necessary legal documentation,
              permits or insurance for the jobs scheduled on our platform,

                operate work-related vehicles and that they have the required
                auto liability insurance. It is essential to comply with legal

                grant MovMonkey permission to conduct background checks, which
                may include references, credit checks, and driving records,

                Depending on the total volume of the job, we simply charge a 30%
                commission, known as the "Magnum Fee", on each job from drivers
                or service providers for website maintenance and promotion. This
                is taken from the total amount before the driver or provider who
                has completed the job is paid. With MovMonkey, drivers and
                providers are not tiers; itâs pay as you go.

              When you cancel for the first time, we'll suspend your account for
              a while and send you an email to make sure you understand our
              cancellation policy. Your account will be reactivated once you
              have replied to our customer support team confirming your
              understanding of the policy. Â  <br />
              Drivers or suppliers who haven't cancelled more than 20% of their
              bookings in the last four weeks can continue to use MovMonkey.
              However, if the rate exceeds 20%, there's a catch: your account
              will be suspended and you will have to pay a fine equal to the
              Magnum fee of the last cancellation. The account will be
              reactivated once this fee has been paid. Â  <br />
